# Simulation---Detecting-Screen-Edges

#### Description:
This was a week 2 assignment. A ball moves in the x- and y-axes, detects edges and comes back
 
#### Installation:
 
You can just copy **B3x0r.github.io** into a browser and paste it into the url line.
 
#### Usage:
 
It is just to watch a ball go back and forth.
 
#### Support: 
 
I don't foresee you needing support at this point.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would like to add balls and change their colors.
